\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present a unified framework proposing that entropy is the fundamental organizing principle of physical reality, and that at extreme compression thresholds—such as inside black holes—entropy collapses from a 3D volumetric distribution to a 2D surface-projected state. This entropy collapse governs the stabilization of mass-energy and the emergence of fundamental particles. We explore a boundary condition known as the Bruno Constant, the threshold where this collapse occurs. Our simulations, figure mapping, and entropy-density projections support a model in which gravitational compression flattens quantum degrees of freedom, leading to dimensional stabilization and information structuring in a lower-dimensional field.

\section{Introduction}
The Entropy Collapse Hypothesis originated from the insight that entropy may not simply be a measure of disorder, but rather the structural boundary condition that guides the emergence of energy, particles, and even time. This project, developed over the course of hundreds of simulations and tracked by timestamped scripts and visual analyses, proposes a new lens through which to unify thermodynamics, General Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics.

\section{Foundational Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Entropy is the primary organizing principle of the universe.
    \item Black holes reach a state of zero entropy at the core (0K-like stabilization).
    \item The Bruno Constant defines the collapse boundary between volumetric and surface entropy distribution.
    \item Dimensional flattening (3D → 2D) is a real physical transformation during gravitational compression.
\end{itemize}

\section{Entropy Collapse Mechanism}
At high compression, matter-energy is forced to organize itself in lower entropy configurations. The Bruno Constant, derived from simulations, marks the proportional threshold where collapse occurs. A 3D volume's entropy surface reaches equivalence with its mass-energy entropy at this boundary, triggering a projection event.

\section{Figure Analysis and Simulation Results}
Visual development sets tracked over multiple phases show consistent convergence toward surface area entropy equivalence. The figures produced between March 23 and 26 reflect the rapid evolution of this idea. All visuals are indexed in \texttt{Figures/Figures Datas/} and mapped to equations.

\section{Dimensional Stabilization and Quantum Convergence}
The hypothesis draws analogies from superconductors and proposes that gravitational compression can lead to a deterministic quantum state—a singularity that is both stable and coherent. The flattening of probability fields at near-zero entropy reveals a mechanism where matter stops behaving statistically and becomes entangled with the collapsed system.

\section{Discussion and Challenges}
While the theory presents a compelling narrative linking entropy and particle formation, there are open challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Experimental validation at black hole cores is impossible with current technology.
    \item The 2D projection mechanism must align with holographic principles without contradicting known GR limits.
    \item Entropy's role in time emergence remains mathematically underdeveloped.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion and Next Steps}
Entropy is not a consequence of energy dispersion; it is the force behind the universe's structure. This hypothesis reframes black holes not as endpoints, but as cosmic stabilizers that anchor physical law. We invite formal peer analysis, constructive criticism, and further simulation testing to explore its limits.
