    "title": "Entropy Collapse Thought Experiment",
    "start_date": "2025-02-17",
    "summary": "This document outlines the chronological development of the Entropy Collapse hypothesis, which explores the idea that entropy is the most fundamental principle governing black holes, the universe, and the emergence of particles. The user hypothesizes that black hole cores reach a low-entropy state that restructures mass-energy into fundamental particles, linking GR, QM, and thermodynamics."
