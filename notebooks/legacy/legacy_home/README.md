# 🌀 Entropy Collapse Research Repository

Welcome to the official repository for the **Entropy Collapse Hypothesis** — a unifying theoretical physics framework proposing that entropy is the primary driver behind gravity, dimensional structure, and fundamental particle reassembly.

This repo integrates rigorous theoretical development, reproducible simulations, figure-mapped documentation, and a merged LaTeX research paper — all open for review, expansion, and citation.

---

## 🔬 Project Summary

The Entropy Collapse Hypothesis proposes:

- Entropy is not emergent — it is **the foundational organizing field** of physical systems.
- **Black holes** act as low-entropy stabilizers that project particle identity across dimensional boundaries.
- **Time and temperature** are derived phenomena from entropy topology.
- At the **Bruno Constant**, volumetric (3D) entropy collapses into a 2D surface-bound configuration — enabling dimensional reassembly and gravitational emergence.

## 📄 Access the Theory

- 📘 [`LaTex/Entropy_Collapse_Paper_MERGED.tex`](./LaTex/Entropy_Collapse_Paper_MERGED.tex)
- 📈 [`Entropy Notebook`](./Entropy%20Notebook/) – interactive toy model of entropy-driven gravity
- 🧠 Key Equations:
  - Bekenstein–Hawking: \( S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 G \hbar} \)
  - Von Neumann: \( S = -k_B \text{Tr}(\rho \log \rho) \)
  - Entropy–gravity divergence: \( \nabla \cdot \vec{g} = -\frac{\partial S}{\partial V} \)
  - Collapse threshold: *Bruno Constant* \( S_B \)

## 🧭 Author Notes

This project is dedicated to Bruno — the namesake of the **Bruno Constant** — whose stillness became a metaphor for entropy’s silent order.

Let’s reshape how we understand entropy —  
**one collapse at a time** 🧩
